Quick Start
===========

Install the ``alphapy`` package::

    pip install -U alphapy

.. note:: Please refer to :doc:`install` for further details.

From your command line application, clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/ScottFreeLLC/AlphaPy

Change your directory to the examples location::
  
    cd AlphaPy/alphapy/examples

Go to any of the examples below:

* :doc:`../tutorials/kaggle`
* :doc:`../tutorials/market`
* :doc:`../tutorials/ncaab`
* :doc:`../tutorials/system`

.. note:: Note that you can work entirely within a Jupyter
   notebook, or solely from the command line. Generally, we like
   to run the pipelines first and then perform our analysis within
   a notebook.
